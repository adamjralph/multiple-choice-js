## Multiple choice quiz

### AIM

I want to create an app that I can use to create training material at work. It needs to be easy to set up and use by non-technical people. It will need to collect the results of the test and print them out at the end.

### INSTALLATION

- Download and unzip to hard drive
- Create a shortcut to index.html
- Click on newly created shortcut

### TECH

I thought about creating a more modern app that could be hosted and store data on a database, but since this project has not yet been approved I wanted to make a mock up that was fully functional. If they like the idea I can make something more modern. I've used JavaScript html and css.

### FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Ideally this app will eventually contain multiple tests as well as a presentation of learning material to proceed the test, so I think eventually it will need a database. In addition I will want it to store the names of the students, their score and the scheduling of the next test or the next refresh test. It will therefore need an admin role, student roles and the ability of admin role to create, update and delete students.
